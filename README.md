Volunteera
=====================================================

Last year, I had a group Software Engineering project, in which we were tasked with solving a real-world problem given by local businesspeople by creating a web-application which followed specific UN sustainable development goals. Our team received a problem statement: ‘How can we create a more efficient way to match volunteers to opportunities? How can we measure social impact?’ 

We created **Volunteera** - an application designed to facilitate the connection between volunteers and organisations to apply to opportunities on a user-friendly platform.

Some of the features I was responsible for was the ability to filter the volunteering opportunities, apply to opportunities on specific dates, and the creation of a global and friends leaderboard of the social impact of volunteers.
Our cohorts projects formed the entrants of the Green Tech Jam, a competition in partnership with the Engineers in Business Fellowship.
At the awards day, we had to present and demonstrate our application to the local businesspeople who had put forward the problem statement, and other judges. We came second out of thirty-three teams, winning £1000 between us.
